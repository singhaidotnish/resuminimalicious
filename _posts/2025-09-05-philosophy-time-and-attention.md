## 🌟 Introduction
- Life is often measured in years → birthdays, anniversaries.  
- But we *live* in days, hours, moments.  
- Hook: attention, not time, is our real currency.  

---

## 📜 Philosophical Background
- Seneca’s *On the Shortness of Life*.  
- Buddhist focus on impermanence and presence.  
- Heidegger: being-toward-death and the urgency of now.

## 🧠 Attention as the Core Resource
- What you attend to shapes your experience.  
- Scattered attention = scattered life.  
- Deep attention = meaning.  

---

## 💡 Practical Insights
- Morning rituals as anchors.  
- Single-tasking over multitasking.  
- Reflecting at night → “Was today well spent?”  

---

## 🙏 Closing Thoughts
- Time is neutral, attention gives it shape.  
- A meaningful life = meaningful days, one after another.
