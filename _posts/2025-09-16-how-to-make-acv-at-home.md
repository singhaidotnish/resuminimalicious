# 🍎 Homemade Apple Cider Vinegar (ACV) Brewing Guide

You can make more ACV at home using the **mother** from a store-bought raw, unfiltered ACV. The mother contains live acetic acid bacteria and yeast that drive the fermentation.

---

## 🥤 Ingredients
- Fresh apples (4–6, any type, organic preferred) OR apple scraps (peels, cores)
- Sugar – 2–3 tbsp (per 1 liter water)
- Water – filtered or boiled & cooled
- Apple cider vinegar (with mother) – 2–4 tbsp (starter)

---

## 🛠️ Equipment
- Wide-mouth glass jar
- Cloth or paper towel + rubber band (for covering)
- Wooden or plastic spoon (not metal)
- Glass bottles/jars with lids for storage

---

## 🧾 Method

### Stage 1 – Alcohol Fermentation
1. Chop apples into chunks (leave skins & cores if organic).
2. Dissolve sugar in water.
3. Place apples in jar, pour sugar water until fully submerged.
4. Add 2–4 tbsp ACV with mother as a starter.
5. Cover jar with cloth, secure with rubber band.
6. Leave in warm, dark place for **2–3 weeks**. Stir daily.
7. Apples will float first, then sink as fermentation progresses.

### Stage 2 – Vinegar Fermentation
1. Strain out solids after 2–3 weeks; keep only liquid.
2. Return liquid to clean jar, add more ACV mother if available.
3. Cover with cloth again and ferment another **3–4 weeks**.
4. Stir every few days, taste periodically.

---

## 🧪 Readiness Check
- Sour, tangy aroma = ready.
- Cloudy strands = healthy mother growth.
- Full process takes **6–8 weeks**.

---

## ⚠️ Tips & Warnings
- Always use glass or ceramic (avoid metal lids, vinegar corrodes metal).
- If mold (fuzzy green/black) appears, discard and restart.
- White film (kahm yeast) is harmless, skim off.
- Store finished ACV in sealed glass bottles in a cool, dark place.

---

## ✅ Summary
- **Stage 1**: Apples + sugar water → yeast makes alcohol.
- **Stage 2**: Mother bacteria convert alcohol → vinegar.
- **Result**: Tangy, probiotic-rich homemade ACV!
