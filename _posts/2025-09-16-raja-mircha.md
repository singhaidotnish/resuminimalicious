# 🌶️ Raja Mircha Pickling & Fermentation Guide

This guide shows three approaches to making raja mircha (bhut jolokia/ghost chili) pickles and hot sauces:

1. **Apple Cider Vinegar (ACV) with mother**  
2. **Traditional lactic acid fermentation (salt brine)**  
3. **Fusion: Double fermentation (brine + ACV)**  

Each method develops unique flavors and storage properties.

### Step 3 – Secondary Ferment

## 4. Flavor Variation Chart

| Style       | Ingredients/Spices                               | Notes |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------|-------|
| **Indian**  | Mustard seeds, turmeric, fenugreek, jaggery      | Sweet-spicy, earthy |
| **Mexican** | Cumin, oregano, lime juice, coriander seeds      | Taco-friendly |
| **Asian**   | Soy sauce, ginger, garlic, sesame oil            | Umami-rich |
| **Fusion**  | Mango, pineapple, ginger                         | Fruity-hot |

## ⚠️ Safety Notes
- Always keep chilies submerged to avoid mold.  
- White film (kahm yeast) is harmless; skim it off.  
- Discard if fuzzy green/black mold develops.  
- Use glass/ceramic, not metal (vinegar corrodes).
