## 🎰 The Pattern

After a win, your brain feels "safe." That money feels like **"free money"** (the house's money), so you're willing to risk it immediately on tomorrow's setup.

This connects directly to your **"eating leftovers" habit**—leaving capital idle feels like "wasting" it, like throwing away food. You feel compelled to make that money "work" immediately.

## ⚡ Unwiring Protocol: Post-Win Overtrade

### The Core Reframing: "Cash is a Position"

You need to change your definition of "wasting."

**Old Thought:**  
*"If my money isn't in a trade, it's doing nothing. That is waste."*

**New Muscle Memory:**  
*"Cash is a valid position. It is a position with 0 Delta, 0 Theta, and 0 Risk."*

When you sit in cash overnight, you're not "doing nothing." You're actively holding a position that is **immune to overnight crashes**.

## 🧠 Key Insight

The compulsion to immediately redeploy winning capital is your brain **misidentifying safety as waste**.

**Cash is protection, not idleness.**
