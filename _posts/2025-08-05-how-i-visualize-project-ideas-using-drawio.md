## 🌟 Introduction
- Why visuals help me think more clearly than plain text.  
- Hook: Turning scattered ideas into diagrams I can build from.  

---

## 🧩 Why Diagrams Work for Me
- ADHD + nonlinear thinking = diagrams fit better than long notes.  
- Quick snapshot of relationships instead of wall of text.  
- Easier to spot gaps / missing connections.  

---

## 🛠️ My Workflow in draw.io
- Start with a blank canvas + a rough sketch.  
- Use shapes for **modules**, **flows**, **APIs**, **data**.  
- Connect ideas with arrows (dependencies, flows).  
- Color coding & icons for clarity.  

---

## 📐 Real Examples
- Algomin → condition builder architecture.  
- Varsity Audio → YouTube → Cloudinary flow.  
- Property docs → family-tree diagrams.  

---

## 💡 Lessons Learned
- “Don’t over-design” → diagrams are for clarity, not perfection.  
- Start broad, refine later.  
- Diagrams + notes together make a strong combo.  

---

## 🙏 Closing Thoughts
- Encourage readers to try visualizing their own messy ideas.  
- Tool doesn’t matter → habit does.
