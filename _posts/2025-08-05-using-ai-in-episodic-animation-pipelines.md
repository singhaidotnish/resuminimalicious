## 🎬 Introduction
- Why episodic animation needs efficient pipelines  
- Challenges of repetition, tight deadlines, and asset reuse  
- Hook: *Where AI can make the invisible work faster and smoother*

---

## 🔄 Pipeline Overview (Baseline)
- Typical episodic workflow (scripting → storyboarding → animatic → layout → animation → compositing → delivery)  
- Where bottlenecks usually occur  
- Your personal experiences or observations  

---

## 🤖 Where AI Fits In
### Pre-Production
- Script breakdowns  
- Auto-generated storyboards / animatics (e.g., RunwayML, Midjourney, custom tools)  

### Production
- Asset tagging, searching, reusing  
- Scene version management  
- Animation assist tools (e.g., inbetweening, lip-sync suggestions)  

### Post-Production
- Automated QC passes (color, continuity, timing)  
- Sound matching, subtitle generation

## 🛠️ Tools & Experiments
- List of AI tools tried (ChatGPT, RunwayML, custom scripts, Blender/Houdini add-ons)  
- What worked, what felt like hype  
- Screenshots or code snippets (optional)  

---

## 🎯 Benefits & Limitations
- Benefits: speed, consistency, artist support  
- Risks: style drift, over-reliance, lack of human nuance  
- ADHD angle: how AI helps you reduce overwhelm by chunking repetitive tasks  

---

## 🌍 Future Directions
- Smarter asset libraries  
- Real-time feedback loops for directors  
- AI-assisted creative collaboration (humans + AI in sync)  

---

## ✨ Personal Reflection
- Why this excites you as a VFX TD / automation-focused creator  
- How it connects to your broader philosophy: **scatter mind → gather workflow**  

---

## 📌 Conclusion
- One-line summary: *AI won’t replace animators, but it will reshape episodic production pipelines.*  
- Invitation: “If you’ve worked on episodic animation, how do you imagine AI fitting into your pipeline?”
