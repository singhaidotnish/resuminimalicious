## 🌟 Introduction
- Quick context: ADHD + curiosity about AI.  
- Why this topic matters to me.  
- What I hope readers will take away (strategies, encouragement, real examples).  

---

## 🧠 The ADHD Brain and Learning Challenges
- Short attention span, hyperfocus bursts, distractions.  
- Difficulty with linear tutorials or long technical docs.  
- Emotional side: frustration, excitement, overwhelm.  

---

## ⚡ What Actually Works for Me
- **Chunking learning** into small, testable experiments.  
- **Building tools, not just reading** — e.g., small AI-infused apps.  
- **Using ChatGPT as a tutor & coding partner.**  
- **Visuals and diagrams** (mind maps, draw.io, pepakura-style notes).  
- **Gamifying tasks** (mini-milestones, treat focus as a sprint).  

---

## 🛠️ My Toolkit
- **ChatGPT / AI assistants** → real-time Q&A, brainstorming.  
- **Notion / Markdown / Jekyll blog** → structuring scattered notes.  
- **VS Code + Copilot** → hands-on coding.  
- **Render / Vercel / Railway** → quick deployments to see progress.  
- **Blender / Houdini experiments** → mixing AI with VFX workflows.  

---

## 🚴 Real-Life Examples
- Building **Varsity Audio** tool step by step.  
- Experimenting with **VFX pipeline automation**.  
- Short projects like **PyQt AI chatbot**.  
- Solo bike ride metaphor → endurance + bursts of hyperfocus.  

---

## 💡 Lessons Learned
- Perfectionism is the enemy; iteration wins.  
- ADHD isn’t a barrier, it’s a different learning engine.  
- Momentum builds confidence more than theory.  

---

## 🙏 Closing Thoughts
- Encouragement for others with ADHD exploring AI.  
- Reminder: progress > perfection.  
- Future: how I’ll keep learning (structured AI + VFX plan).
